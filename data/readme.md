# Administrative units - Uganda

- Districts -> Counties -> Sub-Counties -> Parishes -> Villages

## Intended behaviour

When I search something; say a village - return village(s), with metadata like Village A, in Parish X, Sub-County M, County I, District X

same applies to parish... etc. - result - Parish X, in Sub-County M, District X.
